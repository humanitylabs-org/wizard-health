# Health

A health tracker over the wearables you connect, in plain words, with one traffic light for everything: **green good, yellow okay, red needs attention** (grey = no data). Glance at it and read "green, green, green" or "green, yellow, yellow".

- **Recovery · how ready your body is**: Ready (67–100) green, So-so (34–66) yellow, Run down (0–33) red.
- **Sleep · did you get enough**: judged against what your body needed. 85% of your need or more is green (Enough), 70–85% yellow (A bit short), under 70% red (Short).
- **Activity · did it match your recovery**: effort is not good or bad by itself, so Health compares it with that day's recovery (WHOOP's guidance: Ready about 14–18 on the 0–21 scale, So-so about 10–14, Run down under 10). Inside the target, or resting on a run-down day, is green (Right amount); a little outside is yellow (A bit much / Room to push); well over is red (Too much for today). Doing less is never red.

Each gets one card for the selected day, filled with that day's colour: a big number, a word, one plain sentence and the few numbers behind it (heart rate variability, resting heart rate, blood oxygen and skin temperature; sleep stages; the day's target, calories, steps and workouts). Below it, **every day as a square**, like a GitHub contribution graph, with one shared legend. Tap a square to see that day everywhere (Back to today and Back return to today).

In a wide window Activity, the one to act on, fills the top half, and Recovery and Sleep share the bottom half; all three move together. In a narrow window (a phone) you see one at a time and pick Activity, Recovery or Sleep in a bar at the bottom (it opens on Activity, which says how much more to do today), within reach of your thumb; the squares are big enough to tap, about the last three months fit the screen and older weeks scroll sideways.

A dot in the corner shows how fresh your sources are and opens them.

Health reads every connector app that fills the `health-data` spot (contract `wizard.health-data/1`, see `docs/health-data-contract.md`): WHOOP, Oura, Fitbit, Polar, Withings or any other, with no change to Health. Sources lists each one (connected, behind, or not set up with a **Set up** link to its own app). With two or more connected you pick the **main** source; each day uses its numbers, and anything it missed that day comes from another wearable with a small "from Oura" note. Activity targets follow each wearable's own scale. A wearable that gives no recovery score shows "No score from …", never a made-up one. Connecting happens in each connector's own app; Health never asks for a wearable's keys. It keeps its own copy of the days it has read, so the screen and your agent stay fast, and other apps (such as a morning report) can read the daily summary at `GET /api/summary`.
